# Hi, I'm Nawaf 👋

I like turning messy, manual workflows into **small, composable tools** — AI agents, automations, and web apps that actually get used.

Most of my time goes into:

- 🤖 **AI agents** for research, operations & internal tools  
- ⚙️ **Automation** (n8n, scripts, glue code between SaaS, ERP, and APIs)  
- 🌐 **Full-stack apps** (Next.js / React / Node / Python)  
- 🧾 **Enterprise workflows** (Docentric, D365/AX, reporting & integrations)

## 🔭 Currently hacking on

### 🧠 DeepResearch / research agents

Autonomous-ish research agents that:

- plan → search → read → extract → synthesize → cite  
- behave more like an analyst than a single LLM call  
- output structured reports instead of “here’s a blob of text”

### 📚 ShareDeepResearch

A place to **publish, share and re-use** AI-generated research:

- front-end for DeepResearch output  
- versioned posts, citations, and filters  
- built to be useful for students, analysts, and founders

### 🧰 Email → micro-tool pipelines

Small services that wake up when you send an email:

- CSV diff & validation bots  
- “clean this dataset / map these columns” helpers  
- one-off utilities that accidentally turn into products  

---

## 🧱 Stack (the stuff I actually use)

### Languages / Core

- Python  
- TypeScript  
- JavaScript  
- SQL (Postgres, MySQL)

### Web / Front-end

- React  
- Next.js  
- Tailwind  
- CSS / HTML  

### Backend / Infra

- Node.js  
- FastAPI / Flask  
- Docker  
- Vercel  
- A bit of GCP  

### AI / Automation

- OpenAI  
- Anthropic  
- n8n  
- RAG-style patterns, agents, prompt tooling  

### Data

- PostgreSQL  
- MongoDB  
- Redis  
- Firebase / Supabase when it’s convenient  

---

## 🧪 Selected projects

I’m slowly cleaning up and open-sourcing more of this. For now, highlights:

### 🔬 DeepResearch Agent

“LLM, but behaves like a junior analyst.”

- Multi-step research: question → plan → search → read → compare → report  
- Supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)  
- Outputs markdown reports with references & reasoning trace  

_Repo in progress — this is my daily driver so it changes a lot._

---

### 📚 ShareDeepResearch.ai

UI for exploring & sharing AI-generated research.

- Next.js + TypeScript + Postgres  
- Reads from DeepResearch output format  
- Filters, tags, and “open in original tool” links  

See pinned repos: <https://github.com/greenm8rix>

---

### 🧩 Webcraft / micro-tool experiments

A bunch of small tools pretending not to be a platform.

- Prompt → landing page generators  
- CSV / Excel utilities  
- Scripts around domain discovery, scraping, and automations  

Most live as separate repos or private experiments I’m refactoring.

---

## 🧠 Also into…

- D365FO, AX 2012, Docentric, data migration  
- Turning long, ugly Excel workflows into simple web interfaces  
- Using email as a UI surface (“just forward the file and I’ll do the rest”)  
- Building agents that **own** a workflow instead of just “answering chat”

---

## 📈 GitHub at a glance

repos: 40+ public  
focus: AI agents, automation, full-stack tools  
philosophy: small, composable, actually useful  

(Expect both polished projects and half-broken experiments.)

If you want to:

- collaborate on an AI agent / automation idea  
- integrate AI into an existing product or internal workflow
